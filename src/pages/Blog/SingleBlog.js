            It's the start of a new year, and that means new devices from some
            of the top brands in mobile. One of those companies getting in on
            the action early is OnePlus. Not only are we getting a new
            smartphone in the OnePlus 11, but we're also getting new OnePlus Bud
            Pro 2 earbuds and the OnePlus Pad tablet. In addition to getting
            hands-on time with the OnePlus 11 and the other new devices, XDA was
            fortunate enough to get some one-on-one time with some of the
            members of OnePlus, including Spenser Blank, head of PR and
            communications in North America, Head of Product Strategy Xiaolu
            Hou, and Head of Brand and Marketing Emily Dai. We discussed the
            future of OnePlus, why it has no plans to release a Pro model
            anytime soon, and how it'll break away from the other best phones on
            the market from the likes of Samsung and Google. XDA VIDEO OF THE
            DAY Close Many of our questions were answered with the help of a
            translator. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.
            OnePlus-4-Watermarked Chris Wedel, Mobile Section Editor: It’s been
            reported that there is no plan for a “Pro” device this year. What is
            the reason for the shift when many other brands are offering
            multiple devices in a launch? Xiaolu Hou: So, to answer your
            question, actually, I've got three points to support my answer. The
            first thing is OnePlus has been bridging the premium products,
            delivering a fast and smooth experience at an affordable price. We
            know that the user doesn't really care about the name of the
            product. What they really care about is the experience that a
            product can deliver and its final price. The second point, if you
            take a look, you will find that it is already equipped with the best
            chipset in the market, which is the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, and also the
            flagship level for the graphic experience and the modern elegant
            design with the premium texture. It also means it is the Pro model
            of the OnePlus 11 series.
